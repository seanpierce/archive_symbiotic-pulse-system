# Symbiotic Pulse System
SPS is a dual-voiced, analog-modeled synthesizer developed using VueJS. Leveraging the Web Audio API, SPS creates and connects `VCOs`, `LFOs`, `VCFs` and `VCAs` in a modular pattern. In this context, the leading `VC` in each module's name stands for `Virtually Controlled` as opposed to `Voltage Controlled`.

_Note: maintainers of the web audio api are still working to implement compatability patches for many mobile devises._
